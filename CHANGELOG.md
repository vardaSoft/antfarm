# Changelog

## v0.2.3 — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Scheduler Conflict Prevention**: Daemon now filters runs by `scheduler = 'daemon'` to prevent processing cron-scheduled runs
- **Session Tracking Race Condition**: Fixed DELETE statement in catch block and reduced stale session timeout from 45 min to 15 min
- **Inefficient Daemon Loop**: Added in-memory cache for workflow specs with 5-minute TTL and file change detection
- **Missing Timeout Configuration**: Timeout now derived from `agent.timeoutSeconds` only (removed `workflow.polling.timeoutSeconds`) with 3600s default
- **Redundant Files**: Removed compiled `daemon.js` from repository and updated `.gitignore`

### Added
- **Gateway API Fallback**: Daemon now attempts Gateway API for session spawning with CLI fallback
- Unit tests for daemon and spawner modules
- Cache metrics logging in daemon cleanup loop

## v0.2.2 — 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Prevented mixed timestamp formats from triggering false abandoned-step cleanups
- Guarded pipeline completion when steps or stories are failed/pending

### Added
- Per-agent timeout override for cron sessions via workflow agent `timeoutSeconds`

## v0.2.1 — 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- Hardened pipeline state transitions to avoid marking runs completed on partial failure

## v0.2.0 — 2026-02-09

### Fixed
- Step output now reads from stdin instead of CLI arguments, fixing shell escaping issues that caused complex output (STORIES_JSON, multi-line text) to be silently dropped
- This was the root cause of loop steps (like security audit fixes) completing with zero work done

### Added
- `antfarm version` — show installed version
- `antfarm update` — pull latest, rebuild, and reinstall workflows in one command
- CHANGELOG.md

## v0.1.0 — Initial release

- Multi-agent workflow orchestration for OpenClaw
- Three bundled workflows: feature-dev, bug-fix, security-audit
- Story-based execution with per-story verification
