Task: Redesign the Antfarm landing page to utilitarian repo-style
Started: 2026-02-08 16:16 ET

## Codebase Patterns
- Tests in `landing/__tests__/landing.test.js` check for: id="features", id="quickstart", id="commands", `.hero` and `.feature-grid` in CSS, `@media` in CSS, and that all `href="#x"` have matching `id="x"`
- Tests use `node:test` + `node:assert/strict`, run with `node --test`
- Landing page is pure HTML+CSS, no JS, no build step

## 2026-02-08 16:16 - US-001: Rewrite landing page HTML with utilitarian repo-style layout
- Replaced marketing-style landing page with GitHub-repo-aesthetic utilitarian layout
- 7 sections: header (logo + GitHub link), description, install (id="features"), example (id="quickstart"), dashboard placeholder, commands table (id="commands"), footer
- Dark theme using GitHub-like color palette (#0d1117 bg, #58a6ff accent)
- Zero emoji anywhere
- Kept .hero class on header, .feature-grid in CSS for test compat
- Responsive with @media breakpoint at 640px
- Files changed: landing/index.html, landing/style.css
- **Learnings:** Tests check CSS for class names (.hero, .feature-grid) even if not used in HTML, so keep them in the stylesheet
