# Antfarm

**Build your agent team in [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai) with one command.**

You don't need to hire a dev team. You need to define one. Antfarm gives you a team of specialized AI agents — planner, developer, verifier, tester, reviewer — that work together in reliable, repeatable workflows. One install. Zero infrastructure.

### Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/snarktank/antfarm/v0.5.1/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or just tell your OpenClaw agent: **"install github.com/snarktank/antfarm"**

That's it. Run `antfarm workflow list` to see available workflows.

> **Not on npm.** Antfarm is installed from GitHub, not the npm registry. There is an unrelated `antfarm` package on npm — that's not this.

> **Requires Node.js >= 22.** If `antfarm` fails with a `node:sqlite` error, make sure you're running real Node.js 22+, not Bun's node wrapper (see [#54](https://github.com/snarktank/antfarm/issues/54)).

## What You Get: Agent Team Workflows

### feature-dev `7 agents`

Drop in a feature request. Get back a tested PR. The planner decomposes your task into stories. Each story gets implemented, verified, and tested in isolation. Failures retry automatically. Nothing ships without a code review.

```
plan → setup → implement → verify → test → PR → review
```

### security-audit `7 agents`

Point it at a repo. Get back a security fix PR with regression tests. Scans for vulnerabilities, ranks by severity, patches each one, re-audits after all fixes are applied.

```
scan → prioritize → setup → fix → verify → test → PR
```

### bug-fix `6 agents`

Paste a bug report. Get back a fix with a regression test. Triager reproduces it, investigator finds root cause, fixer patches, verifier confirms. Zero babysitting.

```
triage → investigate → setup → fix → verify → PR
```

## Why It Works

- **Deterministic workflows** — Same workflow, same steps, same order. Not "hopefully the agent remembers to test."
- **Agents verify each other** — The developer doesn't mark their own homework. A separate verifier checks every story against acceptance criteria.
- **Fresh context, every step** — Each agent gets a clean session. No context window bloat. No hallucinated state from 50 messages ago.
- **Retry and escalate** — Failed steps retry automatically. If retries exhaust, it escalates to you. Nothing fails silently.

---

## How It Works

1. **Define** — Agents and steps in YAML. Each agent gets a persona, workspace, and strict acceptance criteria. No ambiguity about who does what.
2. **Install** — One command provisions everything: agent workspaces, cron polling, subagent permissions. No Docker, no queues, no external services.
3. **Run** — Agents poll for work independently. Claim a step, do the work, pass context to the next agent. SQLite tracks state. Cron keeps it moving.

### Minimal by design

YAML + SQLite + cron. That's it. No Redis, no Kafka, no container orchestrator. Antfarm is a TypeScript CLI with zero external dependencies. It runs wherever OpenClaw runs.

### Built on the Ralph loop

Each agent runs in a fresh session with clean context. Memory persists through git history and progress files — the same autonomous loop pattern from [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph), scaled to multi-agent workflows.

## Quick Example

```bash
$ antfarm workflow install feature-dev
✓ Installed workflow: feature-dev

$ antfarm workflow run feature-dev "Add user authentication with OAuth"
Run: a1fdf573
Workflow: feature-dev
Status: running

$ antfarm workflow status "OAuth"
Run: a1fdf573
Workflow: feature-dev
Steps:
  [done   ] plan (planner)
  [done   ] setup (setup)
  [running] implement (developer)  Stories: 3/7 done
  [pending] verify (verifier)
  [pending] test (tester)
  [pending] pr (developer)
  [pending] review (reviewer)
```

## Build Your Own

The bundled workflows are starting points. Define your own agents, steps, retry logic, and verification gates in plain YAML and Markdown. If you can write a prompt, you can build a workflow.

```yaml
id: my-workflow
name: My Custom Workflow
agents:
  - id: researcher
    name: Researcher
    workspace:
      files:
        AGENTS.md: agents/researcher/AGENTS.md

steps:
  - id: research
    agent: researcher
    input: |
      Research {{task}} and report findings.
      Reply with STATUS: done and FINDINGS: ...
    expects: "STATUS: done"
```

## Security

You're installing agent teams that run code on your machine. We take that seriously.

- **Curated repo only** — Antfarm only installs workflows from the official [snarktank/antfarm](https://github.com/snarktank/antfarm) repository. No arbitrary remote sources.
- **Reviewed for prompt injection** — Every workflow is reviewed for prompt injection attacks and malicious agent files before merging.
- **Community contributions welcome** — Want to add a workflow? Submit a PR. All submissions go through careful security review before they ship.
- **Transparent by default** — Every workflow is plain YAML and Markdown. You can read exactly what each agent will do before you install it.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 22
- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) **v2026.2.9+** running on the host
  - Antfarm uses cron jobs for workflow orchestration. Older OpenClaw versions may not expose the cron tool via `/tools/invoke`. Antfarm will automatically fall back to the `openclaw` CLI, but keeping OpenClaw up to date is recommended: `npm update -g openclaw`
- `gh` CLI for PR creation steps

## Event-Driven Scheduler (Daemon Mode)

Antfarm includes an optional event-driven scheduler daemon that significantly reduces LLM costs by eliminating empty polling sessions:

### Cost Savings

**Traditional Cron Approach:**
- 12 queries/hour per workflow (every 5 minutes)
- Each query spins up a full LLM session (~3-4k tokens) even when there's no work
- Empty polls waste **$21.50/hour** across all workflows

**Daemon Approach:**
- 120 queries/hour per workflow (every 30 seconds)
- Lightweight database-only checks with **zero LLM cost**
- Same reliability with **90%+ cost reduction**

### Usage

Start workflows with the daemon scheduler:
```bash
antfarm workflow run feature-dev "Add user authentication" --scheduler=daemon
```

Control the daemon manually:
```bash
antfarm spawner start [--interval 30000]  # Start with 30s polling (default)
antfarm spawner stop                      # Stop the daemon
antfarm spawner status                    # Check daemon status
```

The daemon automatically prevents double-spawning and cleans up abandoned sessions.
